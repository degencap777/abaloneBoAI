# [Name of your AI]

Your pull requests will be rejected if this checklist is not fully complied with.

- [ ] All modifications take place exclusively in your subdirectory in the `ais` directory.
- [ ] If you are using third party Python libraries, they are specified in the `requirements.txt` file in your subdirectory.

If your AI consists of several files, make it clear here which file must be specified as the main file (usually `main.py`).

Describe here in as much detail as you want, what tactics your AI follows and e.g. how well it competes with others.
