# [Name of your AI]

Your pull requests will be rejected if this checklist is not fully complied with.

- [ ] You created your own branch for your AI.
- [ ] All modifications take place exclusively in your subdirectory in the `ais` directory.
- [ ] That subdirectory contains a `README.md` and a `LICENSE.md` *(optional, but recommended)* file at the highest level.
- [ ] If you are using third party Python libraries, they are specified in a `requirements.txt` file in your subdirectory.
- [ ] Your AI has one Python file that implements `turn(board, opponent_move)`.

If your AI consists of several files, make it clear here which file must be specified as the main file.

Describe here in as much detail as you want, what tactics your AI follows and e.g. how well it competes with others.
