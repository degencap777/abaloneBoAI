Abalone
=======

Abalone is a strategy board game for two players, black and white, each with
initially 14 marbles on a hexagonal board (`initial position <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Abalone_standard.svg>`_). During the game
these marbles are moved. The first player to push six of the opponent's marbles
off the board wins the game.

After player 1 (black) has started, the game is played alternately. The player
in turn moves a straight line of either one, two or three marbles in one of six
directions.

When a player makes an *in-line* move (i.e. in one of the two directions in
which the marble line is aligned), they can push the opponent's marbles that
are in the way in front of them. However, they can only push fewer marbles of
the opponent than they move themselves, hence if the player moves two marbles
they can push one, if they move three they can push one or two of the
opponent's marbles. This kind of move is called *sumito*. If an opponent's
marble is pushed off the edge of the board, they lose it.
