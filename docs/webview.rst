Webview
=======

At the end of the game a ``course_of_the_game.json`` file is created. Using
this file the course of the game can be viewed in a web browser. For that
purpose, the ``index.html`` file in the ``html`` directory must be delivered
via a web server.

.. note:: Opening the file in a web browser via the ``file://`` protocol does
   not work for CORS reasons.
